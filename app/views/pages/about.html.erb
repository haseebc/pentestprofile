                                    <p> I'm a freelance pentester (sometimes referred to as an "ethical hacker") and security architect. A lot of my work involve emulating hacker attacks, reviewing the security (or lack of) of the target organisation. Often, IÂ´m required to solution design or architect the future security vision of a specific product. A few of my findings and security articles are published here and there.</p>

                                    <p> Whats slightly different about me is I can hack a target, design an architecture vision and code a solution.</p>

                                    When dealing with my customers directly I use my London based LTD company. However, sometimes I also supplement other security teams in an organisation or at times security testing and design is part of a larger scope.

                                        <p>Mixing deep tech, design and ethical hacking has been a life long journey. Don't be shy about getting intouch.</p>
